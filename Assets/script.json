Make a short video which gives me a tour of this area and tells me about it. For example: What is it used for? What furniture is in the area? How do you use this furniture? What parts of this area do you think are well designed? Which parts do you want to change? I want all of your group to speak during the video. The video should be 4 minutes long.",
